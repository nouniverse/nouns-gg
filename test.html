<h1><strong>OBJECTIVES AND OVERVIEW</strong></h1>
<p><br /></p>
<ol>
  <li>
    To spotlight the Southeast Asian Marvel Snap scene and grow it within the
    region
  </li>
  <li>
    Introducing/proliferating the Nouns Meme in Southeast Asia through
    grassroots esports (Rally more tournament organizer and player knowledge of
    Nouns Esports in the region)
  </li>
  <li>
    To onboard web2 gamers onto web3 through the use of POAPs as a foot in the
    door
  </li>
</ol>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  At Metasports, one of our most beloved IPs is Community Showdown (or ComShow).
  ComShow is a modular IP we use to hold tournaments featuring a variety of
  titles to allow casual players to experience what it is like to play in a
  professionally-produced esports tournaments. Some titles we’ve done in recent
  years:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>ComShow Valorant, with Grab and Legion by Lenovo</li>
  <li>ComShow CS:GO, with VP Game</li>
  <li>ComShow Pokemon VGC, with Razer and Mogul</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>“Nouns ComShow: Marvel Snap”</strong></p>
<p>
  We would love to bring Nouns Esports to it’s first touch in APAC/SEA through
  our dedicated ComShow series for Marvel Snap—with Nouns Esports to be called:
  <strong>Nouns ComShow: Marvel Snap</strong>.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>10-12 Campaign</li>
  <li>8 Weekly Tournaments</li>
  <li>64 Participants</li>
  <li>$225 Prizepool each week</li>
  <li>
    $125 from Nouns Esports to takeover Lead Sponsor and main brand integration
  </li>
  <li>Remaining $100 provided from existing grant from Community Gaming</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<h1><strong>TARGET AUDIENCE</strong></h1>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  By utilizing a web2 title, Metasports aims to reach web2-leaning casual
  players looking to test their mettle against other enthusiasts. Key metrics
  from our last ComShow featuring Marvel Snap:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    We had initially planned room for 64 players per tournament, but had to
    adjust as we received well over 64 entries for all three tournaments,
    resulting in 376 total players joining.
  </li>
  <li>
    186 total matches were played with $800 total being disbursed to the top
    players of each tournament.
  </li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  As a tournament will be ran every week for eight weeks, we’re aiming to fill
  all 64 slots for each Swiss-style tournament, amounting to 512 total players
  but definitely expecting a little over that number to register based on
  previous experience. Registration will be open to casual and competitive
  players alike, and each player will also be asked for a wallet address in
  order to register for the tournaments. This will be how we distribute the POAP
  SBTs through Nouns allowing you to have a record of our participants as well
  as allowing them to be soft-onboarded to Nouns.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h1><strong>BRAND INTEGRATION</strong></h1>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  We would honored to have Nouns Esports come on as a Title Sponsor for this
  ComShow run, to be titled “Nouns ComShow: Marvel Snap”
</p>
<p><br /></p>

<h1><strong>MARKETING AND PROMOTION</strong></h1>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>World Class Asset Production</strong></p>
<p>
  Our creative engine,
  <a href="https://overdrive.gg/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
    ><strong>Overdrive Studios</strong></a
  >, has created stunning key visuals and broadcast assets for tournaments all
  across the globe, and will be ready to facilitate the creation of the
  aforementioned for our Nouns ComShow. Overdrive is an award winning Esports
  design studio in Southeast Asia with clients globally:

</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>The Right Distribution Channel</strong></p>
<p>
  <strong>Facebook Page.</strong> Nouns ComShow will be pushed through the
  SEAesport facebook page, a long-standing media and community IP in Southeast
  Asian esports—having been official media for events like The International in
  Singapore and ESL Genting.
</p>
<p>
  SEAesport Facebook Page:
  <a
    href="https://www.facebook.com/SEAesport"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >https://www.facebook.com/SEAesport</a
  >
</p>
<p>
  Facebook is strong for streaming and content in SEA, the Philippines
  particularly, you’ll find the the SEAesport page stats below:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>51k followers</li>
  <li>380k+ engagements per month</li>
  <li>26.8k average peak impressions per month</li>
</ul>
<p>Our main CALL-TO-ACTION across content will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Join the official Nouns Esports Discord; and,</li>
  <li>
    “Learn more about Nouns and Nouns Esports at _____”, provided links or the
    podcast proposed in this document
  </li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  <strong>Press Release.</strong> We’ll be creating a press release for
  distribution to media contacts we have in the region to bring light to Nouns
  Esports first foray into Southeast Asia. Some contacts we’ll distribute to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Yahoo Esports</li>
  <li>Inquirer Esports</li>
  <li>BitPinas</li>
  <li>The MegaMaxi</li>
  <li>WhatToPlay/TingBits</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  <strong>[Optional] Podcast on Nouns with PPD + Sasquatch.</strong> Produced in
  our studio, we can produce (hosting PPD and/or Sasquatch removtely) a video
  podcast for release in SEAesport Youtube and pushed on social media for
  evergreen content on what Nouns Esports is
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  <strong>Regarding Broadcast.</strong> During ComShow, we usually do live
  giveaways to entice viewership, however while we are excited to broadcast live
  gameplay of Marvel Snap, there is no official spectator or observer mode
  available yet, and as such we are looking to grow the grassroots Marvel Snap
  scene in anticipation of this feature being released. We offer the podcast as
  high-value evergreen content as a great substitute.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  <strong>POAPS SBTs and Community Gaming.</strong> In order to bridge attendees
  with web3, we will be providing POAP SBTs to all participants (competitors and
  viewers[opt-in] alike) in an effort to bring a mainly web2-facing player base
  and audience on-chain. Exposure to play through Community Gaming also allows
  some native discovery to wallets and crypto distribution
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h1><strong>OUR EXPERIENCE</strong></h1>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  As a media house with deep roots in esports and early natives to web3,
  Metasports’s expertise lies in holistic 360° Tournament Operations: total
  tournament production. From rulebooks and tournament formats to broadcast
  overlays and stage design, Metasports has been organizing events from top to
  bottom to deliver experiences gamers love.
</p>
<p>
  The <strong>Lunacian Sports League</strong> (LSL) is one of our biggest IPs:
  as the first and longest-running professionally-organized esports league for
  one of the leading Web3 game titles: Axie Infinity. A Metasports production,
  LSL has been organizing with the support of Sky Mavis since early 2021.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  During our fourth season in 2022, we saw 2,050 participants fight to lay claim
  to their share of a $50,000 USDC prize pool in over 2900+ games played across
  8 qualifiers and playoffs. With over 109.8k live views on FB and Twitch and
  1.3M+ social reach across the LSL Facebook and Twitter, a captive audience
  watched eagerly as players all across the globe competed for top spots in our
  tournament. You can learn more about the Lunacian Sports League and our
  ongoing fifth season

    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    >here</a
  >, as well as on our
  <a href="https://twitter.com/LSL_GG" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"
    >official socials</a
  >.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  Website:

    target="_blank"
    >https://www.lsl.gg/lsl-season-3</a
  >
</p>
<p>
  In 2020, we held the first local
  <strong
    >VALORANT tournament in the Philippines co-presented by GrabFood</strong
  >
  using the ComShow IP to support the worldwide launch of Valorant. We teamed up
  with GrabFood, Legion by Lenovo, Mogul, and XSplit to bring a premiere
  grassroots tournament for the Philippines with endorsement from Riot Games.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  The members of the tournament’s winning team later got scouted to compete for
  one of the PH’s leading Valorant pro teams. With over $2,000 USD in prize pool
  and another $2,000 in vouchers and giveaways, this 6-week campaign saw over
  500 registered players compete in 350 qualifying matches with over 330,000+
  minutes viewed and a staggering 620,000+ in social reach through our official
  channels.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h1><strong>BUDGET AND ROI</strong></h1>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  Budget ask: $1,000+ USDC, all going to prize pool, distributed evenly across 8
  tournaments happening weekly.
</p>
<p>We take no profit or operations costs from the grant for this event.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  Metasports will handle the 360 Tournament Ops for the Nouns ComShow tournament
  production. Nouns Esports will also receive to our SEAesport official Facebook
  page followers by coming on as a Title Sponsor of ComShow, and can expect 40+
  social media posts with Nouns-powered branding for the duration of this
  campaign, as well as two (2) Facebook boosted awareness posts (1 per month of
  the campaign).
</p>
<p>Some stats about our SEAesport Facebook page:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>51k followers</strong></li>
  <li><strong>380k+ engagements per month</strong></li>
  <li><strong>26.8k average peak impressions per month</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  Metasports also has a pre-existing grant from
  <strong>Community Gaming</strong> that will be utilized alongside the
  requested budget. Winners will receive half their winnings in fiat courtesy of
  Community Gaming’s grant, while the other half will be from the requested
  prize pool budget to be disbursed on the chain, in a bid to soft-onboard
  winners on-chain.
</p>
<p>To outline this better:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong
      >Of the budget, $125 USDC will be awarded each week over the course of two
      (2) months, for a total of $1,000 awarded across 8 tournaments over 8
      weeks.</strong
    >
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong
      >Of the Community Gaming grant, $100 USD will be awarded in fiat each week
      over the course of two (2) months, for a total of $800 awarded across 8
      tournaments over 8 weeks.</strong
    >
  </li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  With 8 tournaments and 64 players each, this would mean 512 players
  <strong>minimum</strong> that will be engaged through this campaign to be
  soft-onboarded on-chain, though we are expecting greater than that in
  registrations from experience.<strong> </strong>
