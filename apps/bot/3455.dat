I also have online wins over bbb, mekk, and bbatts. I frequent SoCal locals and have a very strong passion for melee and competition.   This opportunity would be very special to me because I've never competed in a Genesis before and would love to showcase my abilities in melee and as a personality. I've traveled and done well at a few out of region events like Double Down 2022 and Smash Factor X, but I don't get to travel often due to my financial situation and being a university student. If I could have the chance to compete for Nouns, it would genuinely change my life and I won't disappoint.

By the 8 minute mark, every member on Nouns outleveled each pokemon on the enemy team. The match showed true mastery of Inteleon and Leafeon especially, as they went on hyper offensive and invaded the enemy jungler and prevented it from evolving until around the timer hit 7:50. In my artwork, I tried to capture that moment in my style. I did my best to capture each pokemon as good as possible while keeping some light humor in it 	{"children":[{"children":[{"detail":0,"format":0,"mode":"normal","style":"","text":"The most impressive battle by Nouns I have seen was when they faced Divine void.

She has rescued and rehomed over 60 animals in the past 5 years and wanted a way to combine her love for animals and video games in one place. The way we have come up how to do this is having genuine animal shelter animals at the event who need homes and have their adoption fees waived. There will be 8 dogs there who need homes. The top 8 for Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, Super Smash Brothers Melee, and Rivals of Aether will all get to pick a shelter dog to walk out for their sets with.

It was founded in 2016 in a small LAN café in Peoria IL and has since grown to over 1200 members in its community discord. Originally, the league had only 4 teams and would host a small tournament. Each season saw the league grow more and more, with COVID being a huge catalyst bringing more players to the league. Now, we have 40-48 teams each season, with about 200-250 players signing up for the league. We have players that play mostly in the US Midwest but also from all over the world including South America, Canada, Russia, UK, and more. Players play in the online or LAN tournament and compete for the community funded prize pool. As an organization, MD2L has given out close to $13,000 in prize pool money. 	{"children":[{"children":[{"detail":0,"format":0,"mode":"normal","style":"","text":"Overview: ","type":"text","version":1}],"direction":"ltr","format":"","indent":0,"type":"paragraph","version":1,"textFormat":0},{"children":[{"detail":0,"format":0,"mode":"normal","style":"","text":"The Midwest Dota 2 League is a North American Dota 2 grassroots league that is primarily focused on bringing high quality and high integrity tournaments to amateur Dota 2 players.

However there is only so much I can do from my little island nation. The opportunity to get to talk to these players I admire so much in person is not something that I get very often as well as the chance to record in person footage and interviews that come across way better in a documentary than those taken on discord. I firmly believe that getting the chance to go out there and see these events in person will only make the videos I produce better but unfortunately the funds from my still young channel aren't exactly enough to get me out there on my own, if I were to win it would be my first ever time visiting the states. 	{"children":[{"children":[{"detail":0,"format":0,"mode":"normal","style":"","text":"Why You Should Vote For Chaler","type":"text","version":1}],"direction":"ltr","format":"","indent":0,"type":"heading","version":1,"tag":"h1"},{"children":[{"detail":0,"format":0,"mode":"normal","style":"","text":"I have been part of the melee scene for 8 years as a player and TO but I have always been enamoured with the story's of the best players in our game and in recent times I have started making documentaries about the all the different kinds of stories in our beautiful game.

It's a real-time multiplayer game with gameplay happening in servers of up to 30 players. It's a very social experience, with players spectating each others fights, chatting with another, and playing mini-games. Like many in Nouns Esports, we care a lot about real competition in games. Most (mobile) games today have opted for special characters, items and upgrades that make the player stronger, just so they can milk as much money out of the players as possible. We hate this development, and instead are opting for a 100% skill-based multiplayer without any way to pay your way to victory. While the game is relatively simple, the skill cap is very high and that's why it would be very well suited for a competitive scene! 	{"children":[{"children":[{"detail":0,"format":1,"mode":"normal","style":"","text":"The Game:","type":"text","version":1}],"direction":"ltr","format":"","indent":0,"type":"paragraph","version":1,"textFormat":0},{"children":[{"detail":0,"format":0,"mode":"normal","style":"","text":"We have built an arcade style fighting game called Stumble upon Rumble.

172	0x72CAEb2CcbacBdaC7cb7A88DDE12887e63b0BBE6	pokemon-art-contest	Nouns fight to the finish!	My name is Halvor, I am an animation and digital arts student living in Norway. The most impressive battle by Nouns I have seen was when they faced Divine void. By the 8 minute mark, every member on Nouns outleveled each pokemon on the enemy team. The match showed true mastery of Inteleon and Leafeon especially, as they went on hyper offensive and invaded the enemy jungler and prevented it from evolving until around the timer hit 7:50. In my artwork, I tried to capture that moment in my style. I did my best to capture each pokemon as good as possible while keeping some light humor in it. If you want to see more of my artwork, you can visit my account on instagram- @halvsketchy 	{"children":[{"children":[{"detail":0,"format":0,"mode":"normal","style":"","text":"My name is Halvor, I am an animation and digital arts student living in Norway.

I would love for the chance to represent Nouns at Tipped Off, I have a drive that is unmatched and I am extremely determined to further prove to the world outside of Australia just how cracked I am B)","type":"text","version":1},{"children":[{"altText":"","caption":{"editorState":{"root":{"children":[],"direction":"ltr","format":"","indent":0,"type":"root","version":1}}},"height":0,"maxWidth":500,"showCaption":false,"src":"https://ipfs.nouns.gg/ipfs/Qmc5PsmTPd281MZrDKPPHfCBZk7wMoiwTL4c8yHEwKDYah","type":"image","version":1,"width":0}],"direction":null,"format":"","indent":0,"type":"paragraph","version":1,"textFormat":0}],"direction":"ltr","format":"","indent":0,"type":"paragraph","version":1,"textFormat":0}],"direction":"ltr","format":"","indent":0,"type":"root","version":1}	0	2024-05-10 01:35:45	f	t	50	https://ipfs.nouns.gg/ipfs/Qmc5PsmTPd281MZrDKPPHfCBZk7wMoiwTL4c8yHEwKDYah

285	did:privy:clz0lbg84086ktgnfqw7ps4tp	riptide-2024	Seesaw, Incineroar Gaming	Hello! I'm Jake "Seesaw" West, one of the best Incineroar players in the United States, hailing from Washington, with wins on players such as Kaninabe, Bassmage, Ouch, JDV, Moxi, Captain L, Peckham, and Doorstop. I'm ranked in both Washington and BC due to my heavy participation in both regions. I'm also a huge doubles enthusiast with several top 50 wins and top 8 placements at majors in the format, including a top 3 placing at GOML 2023 with wins over players like MKLeo, Big Boss, Lemmon, and Machu. I believe I would be a good pick for this opportunity for a couple of reasons. Firstly, I turn up at majors. In the last couple years I've gotten 33rd at GOML 2024, 25th at Battle of BC 6, 49th at Port Priority 8, and 49th at GOML 2023. I've gotten better every single year I've played this game and have full confidence in myself to be able to keep it going and turn up the jets at big events when given the opportunity to show what I can do. Secondly, I play an underrepresented character that most people would like to see more of. Scroll through Ultimate Twitter for 5 minutes during a major and you'll see hundreds of complaints about having to watch the same Steve, Sonic, and Game & Watch games play out over and over again. Right now Skyjay is the only Incin contributing on an international stage, and people love watching him (myself included), but I'd like to show that top level Incin play isn't a 1 man show. Finally, I'd like to bring more exposure to the PNW. I believe we are one of the most underrated regions in the world, and even though recently players like Big D and Ouch have been bringing a little more attention to us I want to show that there's leagues of threatening players residing here. I love repping my character, I love repping my region, and I think if you let me represent Nouns I'll love that too. Thank you! 	{"children":[{"children":[{"detail":0,"format":0,"mode":"normal","style":"","text":"Hello!

This journey has been nothing short of a miracle, filled with both challenges and triumphs. Originally, Solar Flare was planned as a two-day event at Humber College, thanks to the invaluable assistance of their esports department head. I submitted a license application to Nintendo three months before announcing the event. However, despite the passage of five months, I have yet to receive a response. A crucial requirement from the college was securing this license to host Smash Ultimate and Melee tournaments. Without it, I had to pivot. 	{"children":[{"children":[{"detail":0,"format":0,"mode":"normal","style":"","text":"My name is Nikola Tan, also known as NickSF, and I am thrilled to be hosting Sunrise and Solar Flare 2024 on July 13th-14th in Ontario, Canada.

As a Melee player from Australia, opportunities to travel to the states come few and far between. I eventually plan to move to America so traveling to events becomes easier but right now my only chance for getting to events is through sponsorships. Unfortunately in Australia it is basically impossible to find anyone who’s love and passion for the game matches mine. In my previous opportunities to travel to America I got to meet a myriad of different players who all had a love for the game and a drive that I had only ever seen in myself (and Joshman lol). Seeing these kinds of people only fueled my love and passion for melee even more and has made me so much more determined to be able to live in America so I can not only be among those people but surpass them as well.

I'm malk, I've been a diehard platform fighter player since early 2014, originally starting with Melee but eventually playing various platform fighters over the years, including all of the official Smash games, mods like Brawl Minus and Project M/+, fan games like Super Smash Flash 2 and Super Smash Bros Crusade (including having spent time on the dev team), and other games like Rivals of Aether, Rivals 2, and Slap City. Nowadays, my main focus is P+, where I am one of the strongest players in my region with wins over Hyperflame, Junebug, Shadowhawke, and many other high level players, but I'm looking to make a splash in Rivals 2 once it drops! I've already had a strong start during the beta period, where I've won every event in my region (we'll see how I do at Hitfall 3!) without dropping a set and had a strong 5th place performance at Creed 3, where I gained wins over the likes of MSB and Jut as well as tied for highest placing Kragg of the event! Due to various circumstances over the years, I've rarely had the opportunity to travel outside of my home region of MDVA. I would kill for the chance to be able to rep Nouns at Riptide for Rivals 2 and P+ and finally get a chance to leave/compete outside of the east coast for the first time in my life! It's been a dream of mine to be able to compete at a huge out of region major like this for as long as I've been playing, so I would be forever grateful if you voted for me! 	{"children":[{"children":[{"detail":0,"format":0,"mode":"normal","style":"","text":"Heya!

This is my first time REALLY playing a Street Fighter game, and I knew Jamie was going to be my main the moment I saw the gameplay reveal trailer. This combo is only possible against Luke and Ken, due to how high up their DP's end and the speed that they fall. Even then, the 2.HP at the start of the combo is frame-perfect, manually timed, and timed differently between characters. Hit it too early, and you can't cancel into heavy DP. Too late, and they won't be hit high enough. After SA3, which can't be delayed by even a single frame, the drive rush has to be perfect, otherwise you'll spend too much drive gauge to do the combo properly. Following the drive rush 2.HP, you have to cancel with light palm, which leaves the opponent airborne just long enough to microwalk for 1-3 frames and 5.HP. This builds a tiny amount of drive gauge, keeping JUST enough drive gauge to not burn yourself out. After you DR cancel into tensei kick, you can only do j.Mp, as j.Hk no longer connects, followed by OD divekick, and finishing with light DP. If you do the light DP as soon as possible, you're left with 42 frames of advantage. The execution for this combo is very tight, requiring knowledge of the opponent, a frame-perfect starter, and a 3 frame microwalk in between. At 6.4k damage, it's only about 500 damage short (not including CA) of his max, while being WAY more stylish, and actually leaves you with drive gauge to spare. 	{"children":[{"children":[{"detail":0,"format":0,"mode":"normal","style":"","text":"I am a BIG Jamie fan from the East Coast of the US, and I spend pretty much all of my time in SF in training mode trying to find the coolest things I can.

Also, I have an undefeated or dominant record on the fellow players that have sent in proposals (of the ones that I have played). As of writing this on 7/16/24, I am currently 10th on the Slippi Leaderboards globally and the highest ranking solo Sheik, ranking in the top 30 the previous two seasons, and have peaked as high as 5th.

However, with there being no guarantee on how long any tourney series will last (RIP Big House and Shine) and not knowing how long I'll be able to continue playing Melee (I'm THIRTY-three!), I decided last year to venture out and make the effort to attend more big tourneys that I hadn't attended before and were outside of my local region, including Off-Season 2, Luminosity Makes Moves Miami, Santa Paws, and Combo Breaker 2024, made the top cut at every single one, and even won a couple \\"Arcadian\\" events along the way. I'm already attending Warehouse War 4 later this month, and being able to attend Supernova would cross another big name series off my \\"bucket list\\" of remaining tourneys I've yet to attend and attempt to make a big run at. Major success at any one of these could also propel me to attend even more tourneys later in the year and beyond, such as Riptide and other big regionals/majors, so the more I get to attend, the better chance that'll happen, and maybe even obtain a coveted Top 100 rank!","type":"text","version":1}],"direction":"ltr","format":"","indent":0,"type":"paragraph","version":1,"textFormat":0},{"children":[],"direction":"ltr","format":"","indent":0,"type":"paragraph","version":1,"textFormat":0},{"children":[{"detail":0,"format":0,"mode":"normal","style":"","text":"Nouns already has one Salt, so why not add another one to the team ;)","type":"text","version":1}],"direction":"ltr","format":"","indent":0,"type":"paragraph","version":1,"textFormat":0},{"children":[{"detail":0,"format":0,"mode":"normal","style":"","text":"You can find me on Twitter/X: ","type":"text","version":1},{"children":[{"detail":0,"format":0,"mode":"normal","style":"","text":"https://twitter.com/JSalt_","type":"text","version":1}],"direction":"ltr","format":"","indent":0,"type":"autolink","version":1,"rel":"noreferrer","target":"_blank","title":null,"url":"https://twitter.com/JSalt_"}],"direction":"ltr","format":"","indent":0,"type":"paragraph","version":1,"textFormat":0},{"children":[{"detail":0,"format":0,"mode":"normal","style":"","text":"Twitch (soonTM): ","type":"text","version":1},{"children":[{"detail":0,"format":0,"mode":"normal","style":"","text":"https://www.twitch.tv/jsalt","type":"text","version":1}],"direction":"ltr","format":"","indent":0,"type":"autolink","version":1,"rel":"noreferrer","target":"_blank","title":null,"url":"https://www.twitch.tv/jsalt"}],"direction":"ltr","format":"","indent":0,"type":"paragraph","version":1,"textFormat":0}],"direction":"ltr","format":"","indent":0,"type":"root","version":1}	0	2024-07-16 22:59:35.146	f	t	33	https://ipfs.nouns.gg/ipfs/QmRqF68kgM8mtuEFyR14PEu2oUim1kQLqFqL7uFz7QkX9D

Além de jogar e curtir Valorant, eu apoio com tudo as causas que buscam tornar o jogo mais inclusivo. Não importa sua etnia ou sexualidade, todo mundo merece ter seu espaço e reconhecimento nesse cenário. Caso eu seja aprovado como um dos streamers do evento, já tenho confirmado a participação de um caster/comentarista_ (@dayzvlr) que entrará junto comigo no projeto. Além disso, a streamer soy taki (@soy takii), que faz parte da organização Nouns, também vai me ajudar diretamente nas transmissões e nas watch parties. Ah, e meu Twitter é @dntsvlr, caso queiram me seguir por lá. Sobre o orçamento de $500, acho que o melhor seria destinar $350 pra premiação, o que deixaria o torneio ainda mais competitivo e atraente. Com os outros $150, dá pra cobrir os custos internos, como aluguel de servidores, infraestrutura de streaming, e também algum marketing pra divulgar o evento e atrair mais gente.

Por isso, acredito que posso ser uma ótima escolha como um dos streamers do evento, trazendo não só uma boa transmissão, mas também ajudando a reforçar os valores de inclusão e diversidade que o evento representa","type":"text","version":1}],"direction":"ltr","format":"","indent":0,"type":"paragraph","version":1,"textFormat":0}],"direction":"ltr","format":"","indent":0,"type":"root","version":1}	0	2024-08-15 17:23:22.413	f	t	0

Learning that TP angle to top plat took a long time but honestly the skill factor in that is a lot less cool now that most people run with notches or boxx (i'm still on a un-notched controller for what it's worth). It's definitely not the most technical combo I've ever hit but I think it makes up for it with how it flows much better than a lot of other stuff, plus I kinda just delete most of my clips as soon as I use them in a combo vid, so my choice was between this and only like 4 others. Using disable to force tumble rather than as a finisher or something to stun them on ground is pretty rare for m2 combo's so I'd like to think it's decently creative, along with using upsmash after knowing that i took his jump and that it beats dair. I don't use twitter other than to just shoot out a message when I finish combo vids, been in a rut of not hitting the most original stuff recently though, so hopefully this one is decent enough. 	{"children":[{"children":[{"children":[{"detail":0,"format":0,"mode":"normal","style":"","text":"https://twitter.com/VVonders292/status/1826316517622923301","type":"text","version":1}],"direction":"ltr","format":"","indent":0,"type":"autolink","version":1,"rel":"noreferrer","target":"_blank","title":null,"url":"https://twitter.com/VVonders292/status/1826316517622923301"},{"detail":0,"format":0,"mode":"normal","style":"","text":" - interesting use of disable where it forces em into tumble if it doesn't hit them while in tumble or in a grounded state, so the falco got like 1 or 2f of dj out before the first hit which forced him to pretty much have no control over the rest.

This combo took me 4 hours to land (it's not that hard) mainly because of its 2 rejump​s. I have never seen a Juri land a combo like this online but it's not too difficult once you learn it. This combo is only possible in the corner with 3 fuha stocks. If there is any delay in the combo, you wont be able to do the enders because the full combo does take up the whole Feng Shui Engine meter. With that being said, you will have to hit confirm with a medium or a heavy attack into Feng Shui Engine to start the combo. After you hit confirm into level 2, you must start the combo with forward heavy punch in order to get more plus frames for the loops. After the first loop, you have to add in an extra crouching medium punch in order to keep the combo going. After the jump cancel, you need to delay the jumping medium punch and heavy kick just a little in order to get the first rejump. Anyways here it is😁  	{"children":[{"children":[{"detail":0,"format":0,"mode":"normal","style":"","text":"Hey there👋 I'm kina.

287	did:privy:clz0qgade0cl3bc1rv704iya9	riptide-2024	KUNOAH REGIONAL EXPLORER (Lucas Main)	Hey, my name is Noah. I have been playing Smash Ultimate since the game came out grinding the crap out of quickplay and playing amongst friends almost in any situation I can get. My first introduction to the franchise is when I got Smash Brawl for the Wii. Playing through Subspace Emissary and having it as a fun party game at gatherings so much more special. I played Smash 4, but I did not really understand the competitive scene or even what labbing is. Like for many others who recently started this game, I started competing in the online era because COVID made it hard for there to even be a scene. Some notable placements include placing 257th at the SWT NA Northeast Ultimate Online Qualifier and 9th at Smash Ultimate Online East Coast. When offline locals became a thing, I found myself unsure if I would do well other that just my school brackets. My first official experience of the offline smash scene was actually in Singapore in Fall 2023. I found myself not only doing well getting 7th at APC 31 and 17th/62 at Asia esports Festival 2023, but I was able to develop community with people that also want to get better at the game as well. I evidently was only there from Aug to Dec because my exchange program was over. That new perspective and experience helped me be able to get 9th on the Dayton Ohio PR in the following Spring Season. Unfortunately, I am not present there anymore because I graduated from my college and started competing back home. As of this middle of this May, I started being a part of the North Carolina scene placing 193rd at Patchwork 2024 which was my first major to ever attend. I know I have not competed at the offline scene nearly as much, but I know that with the right motivation and drive I will strive to become the best player I can be. For me personally, this game had allowed me to meet people I never would have met otherwise as well as make some pretty close friends that helped me reach potential in grinding the game I would have never deemed possible.  	{"children":[{"children":[{"detail":0,"format":0,"mode":"normal","style":"","text":"Hey, my name is Noah.

For perspective, Xanadu and BMW, the two strongest and most consistent locals in our region, average between 12-20 entrants weekly.  I am being mentored and guided by Tournament Organizers with 10+ years of experience. Along with TO’ing my own event I have assisted with the beloved and two year long running Baltimore Melee Weekly. Our region is very strong and supportive of our TOs and we always have great showings and viewership. Our target audience, though a smaller event, is actually cross country. My team is hoping to build this into a strong annual regional over the years. This will be an event similar to Smash Camp New Lands, in that it will be smaller in entrants, but more exclusive. This event is meant to be an unforgettable weekend for the attendees. Similar to Tipped Off, we hope to provide a 10/10 experience for attendees, and have that translate to more word of mouth grassroots growth. Nouns will have static graphics throughout the entire stream. We have a few plans for social media activation and Noun’s involvement. We want to host a free to enter raffle for in person attendees for Nouns merch, which will be featured on stream. I would also like to offer 3 Nouns hats to live viewers. We will put out predictions in chat during stream games, and will offer 1 winner a free Nouns hat upon the games ending. We’d also like it if Nouns could send us some Noggles for portraits from our media team.

Melee player that has loved engaging with the community, and playing the game as a whole. In the 7 months I've been playing this game, I have taken lessons from players Zuppy and Nouns Cody Schwab to improve on neutral and punish, taken games off of players like OG Kid, and have made good rankings in online and offline tournaments like 385th in Get On My Level X, and 17th in online tournaments like Only Noobs. I would be a great player for your roster because of how fast I've learned the game, and how I love to engage with the community. Going to a supermajor was one of the biggest jumps for me as a player.

I have been an avid watcher of Dota 2 Esports since I was around 11 years old.

This roster inspired me to great lengths to improve myself to compete with the best. Over the years as I watched EG slowly deteriorate, I still watch the scene to not only improve myself and keep up with the meta, but to also keep up with the scene. So not only am I up to date with the current scene, I would love to watch Nouns dominate and secure TI13 and bring NA to glory!!!","type":"text","version":1},{"type":"linebreak","version":1},{"type":"linebreak","version":1}],"direction":"ltr","format":"","indent":0,"type":"paragraph","version":1,"textFormat":1},{"children":[],"direction":"ltr","format":"","indent":0,"type":"paragraph","version":1,"textFormat":1}],"direction":"ltr","format":"","indent":0,"type":"root","version":1}	0	2024-07-20 00:57:02.242	f	t	1

Over the past 2-3 years, I was actively involved in the NFT community and I still have my 3D collection, where I have gained much experience and understanding of some skills. I have also been studying UI/UX design for a few months. My journey has been driven by a desire to make useful skills for my future and I still explore interesting fields. I have been making 2D artwork since I was 12 years old on my phone, then I explored NFTs and started learning 3D modeling in Blender software. I was also involved in gaming over the past years and playing Minecraft, CS2, Roblox, Brawl Stars, Fortnite, and Apex.  Additionally, I'm actively involved in Nouns Animators Rounds, which has allowed me to start learning 2D animations and connect with people on Farcaster. I'm currently a beginner animator and trying to improve my skills. 	{"children":[{"children":[{"detail":0,"format":0,"mode":"normal","style":"","text":"Hi, My name is Beqa, I'm 15 years old, from Georgia.

I try to play in a way that inspires people to be the coolest player they can be. I've been playing competitive melee for almost 11 years now, and I've never had the chance to compete at a major event throughout that time. To be honest, majors are quite expensive, and I've had to be very careful with what I could spend money on. It doesn't help that I've lived in a pretty remote region for the last few years, making even going to locals a challenge, as they're rarely less than an hour away. I would sometimes find myself driving 2 hours for a free college local just for the love of the game and to get the chance to play some tournament melee. I love this game, and competing at majors has always been a dream I've had since I began this journey when I was 14, and it would mean the world if anyone reading this would consider dropping a vote my way. My results are sparse but my resolve is vast. Here is a combo vid of mine to get an idea of what kind of gameplay I can display:  	{"children":[{"children":[{"detail":0,"format":0,"mode":"normal","style":"","text":"Hi, I'm WARDOGZ, a melee spacies/falcon/marth player from PA mostly known for my combo videos.

I am a high level player in the Australian melee scene. This combo was from a friendlies session played against Yoshzzz, another high level player in the region. I would say that most of the style and creativity comes from the end of the combo. Landing on the side platform with an up air to techchase the top platform serves as an effective situational DI callout, reading the opponent's DI to the right side of the stage with my landing position to open up the maximum number of combo routes I can continue with. From here, I choose to kill by landing weak reverse down air, edgecancelling it with drift towards Fox and converting with strong down air to kill. This is a flashy combo route with fluid movement and fast execution, as well as being a creative route that I don't see a huge amount of people go for. It also has practical merit, being an effective callout on DI in while likely still sending far enough offstage had the opponent DI'ed away to convert into an edgeguard. 	{"children":[{"children":[{"detail":0,"format":0,"mode":"normal","style":"","text":"Combo found here: ","type":"text","version":1},{"children":[{"detail":0,"format":0,"mode":"normal","style":"","text":"https://streamable.com/upl02w","type":"text","version":1}],"direction":"ltr","format":"","indent":0,"type":"autolink","version":1,"rel":"noreferrer","target":"_blank","title":null,"url":"https://streamable.com/upl02w"}],"direction":"ltr","format":"","indent":0,"type":"paragraph","version":1,"textFormat":0},{"children":[{"detail":0,"format":0,"mode":"normal","style":"","text":"My twitter is at ","type":"text","version":1},{"children":[{"detail":0,"format":0,"mode":"normal","style":"","text":"https://x.com/_gaming_moment","type":"text","version":1}],"direction":"ltr","format":"","indent":0,"type":"autolink","version":1,"rel":"noreferrer","target":"_blank","title":null,"url":"https://x.com/_gaming_moment"}],"direction":"ltr","format":"","indent":0,"type":"paragraph","version":1,"textFormat":0},{"children":[],"direction":null,"format":"","indent":0,"type":"paragraph","version":1,"textFormat":0},{"children":[{"detail":0,"format":0,"mode":"normal","style":"","text":"Hey, my tag is Chibe!

This combo showcases multiple of my favorite Ice Climbers combo tools at an breakneck pace, with fast and creative decision-making to finish the game with a 0 to death. I forgo the standard, guaranteed handoff kill in favor of a flashy and unique combo route. One of Melee's most beautiful aspects is the free-flowing punish game, which requires players to constantly innovate in response to changes in their opponent's DI and positioning. Ice Climbers double the variables in this equation as the player has to anticipate and respond to both the opponent and Nana's AI decisions. Most Ice Climbers wil try to keep their movement and combos simple and guaranteed to minimize the uncertainty, but I react to both Nana and the opponent to construct a one-of-a-kind sequence from  unsteady, ever-shifting building blocks.  	{"children":[{"children":[{"children":[{"detail":0,"format":0,"mode":"normal","style":"","text":"https://x.com/shieldgrabber/status/1778927296071516487?t=3I1r-707zftgIPJX0Uniaw&s=19","type":"text","version":1}],"direction":"ltr","format":"","indent":0,"type":"autolink","version":1,"rel":"noreferrer","target":"_blank","title":null,"url":"https://x.com/shieldgrabber/status/1778927296071516487?t=3I1r-707zftgIPJX0Uniaw&s=19"}],"direction":"ltr","format":"","indent":0,"type":"paragraph","version":1,"textFormat":0},{"children":[],"direction":"ltr","format":"","indent":0,"type":"paragraph","version":1,"textFormat":0},{"children":[{"detail":0,"format":0,"mode":"normal","style":"","text":"I usually prefer my combos speak for themselves but I'll try to explain why this is a combo that's extremely satisfying anyone from a veteran Ice Climbers player to a casual spectator.","type":"text","version":1}],"direction":"ltr","format":"","indent":0,"type":"paragraph","version":1,"textFormat":0},{"children":[],"direction":"ltr","format":"","indent":0,"type":"paragraph","version":1,"textFormat":0},{"children":[{"detail":0,"format":0,"mode":"normal","style":"","text":"This combo showcases multiple of my favorite Ice Climbers combo tools at an breakneck pace, with fast and creative decision-making to finish the game with a 0 to death.

I am submitting this combo as I believe it is one of the most creative and difficult Doc combos I've done! Particularly, I think I did a great job using movement to bait out sub-optimal defensive options from my opponent and constantly put him in bad situations. I also did a great job using all of Dr. Mario's tools, which are not particularly combo friendly. After getting the Falco off-stage, he recovers back and I respond by doing an invincible ledge dash up smash, into an Up-B cancel! He gets to top platform and lands by the edge of the platform, which ends up ledge-canceling his recovery frames on wakeup. He uses this to fullhop Dair as I approach, but I double jump waveland back to fall off the platform to bait this, and I double jump dair which shield pokes him, get the late uptilt hitbox to send him up, and end it with a fair. I think it looks great and is also a very difficult combo to perform with Dr. Mario!
