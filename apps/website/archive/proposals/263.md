**TLDR:** Nouns has established itself in tier one esports competition. Let's keep the momentum going! This is our opportunity at becoming a globally recognized legacy brand in esports.

## Description

Our aim is for Nouns DAO to become a tier one, legacy esports brand. To achieve that, we need to consistently support our top-tier professional esports teams. This proposal ensures ongoing financial backing and assistance for our teams during the 2023 season, enabling us to continue cultivating an impactful esports brand and fostering strong community support around it.

Our support paid off when they competed in front of over 200,000 live viewers - Influencer Taki has gained a significant following on social media, including over 100,000 followers on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/soy_taki) and regularly streams to over a thousand people on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/soy_taki).

Instead of traditional sponsors (_cough, betting_) we are taking the sub communities of Nouns along with us to competitions - [Nouns.gg](https://nouns.gg/) can be used to redirect to various nounish websites during events.

These stickers are applied as decorations to in-game items - The CSGO skins marketplace, dubbed as the "original NFT market", is now worth billions (with millions in daily volume) - _CSGO Stickers would be similar to what we've already achieved in Dota. The below Team Sticker is already in the game from our participation in [The International 2022](https://liquipedia.net/dota2/TheInternational/2022/LastChanceQualifier)_ ![](https://i.imgur.com/qxWP4gw.png) #### **Placements** - Past results - 1st place Ace North American masters - 1st place Intel Extreme Masters Dallas: NA Qualifier - 1st place CCT NA Series #3 - 1st place ESEA Cash Cup: NA Winter #2 - 2nd place ESEA Cash Cup: Na Winter #1 - 3rd place EPL Na Conference - 2nd place CCT NA Series #2 - 2nd place ESL Challenger League Season 42 NA - 2nd place Fireleague 2022 NA - Qualified For (Upcoming) - **IEM Dallas 2023** [international event] - **BlastTV Paris Major 2023: North American RMR** [sticker potential] - **CCT Finals** [$200k purse and potential LAN] #### **Schedule of Events** ![](https://i.imgur.com/TmVczHQ.png) ## Event Spotlights **Dota Pro Circuit** The regular season format that is stepping stones to The International. The 2023 Summer Season will begin in May and culminates with a Major in Bali in late June. **DreamLeague Season 19** Our Dota team was invited to a 1 million dollar tournament as one of the 16 best teams in the world. This tournament circuit is ran by ESL, the biggest esports company in the world. Our success at this event will allow us to participate in a 15 million dollar grand final later this year. ![](https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/sDgIIzb2UMj-OTHG8G4POauhmFeRE95o3oartDmdi84/https/pbs.twimg.com/media/FrqIBzJWYAEvYSZ.jpg) **Blast Paris Major 2023 North American RMR** The Counter Strike sticker opportunity. Our team is in Monterrey Mexico, competing against top teams from the Americas for a spot at the [Paris Major](https://liquipedia.net/counterstrike/BLAST/Major/2023/Paris) in May. **IEM Dallas** Our CSGO team has qualified for IEM Dallas starting May 29th. IEM Dallas is an S-Tier event just barely below a Major. It will pit Nouns against the worlds best international teams, with hundreds of thousands of viewers. 2022's iteration (pictured below) had over 12.5 million hours watched and a crowd seating thousands. ![](https://i.imgur.com/DmQCdf3.png) ## Proposal Success Metrics & Vision - Tournament wins and participation - Continuing to compete at some of the biggest tournaments in the world, such as Majors and The International - Viewership - Due to the success of our teams we expect to be at significantly more tier one events than last year. Regular 10K to 100K+ viewership is expected - The highest view count so far was 200.000+ live viewers during a nail-biting series against MiBR at the CS:GO NA RMR - Social media growth - Approaching 7000 followers on our main Twitter account & multiple of our players have over 50k followers - Discord server with 2400 members in total and a growing group of active contributors - In-game branding - Dota will continue to have Nouns assets thanks to participation in the Pro Circuit - In CS, we need to qualify for an upcoming Major, doing so would guarantee permanent Nounish branding inside of the game - Acquiring additional partners aligned to our Nounish ethos - We'll seek partners that share our values and vision for long-term growth, prioritizing alignment with our Nounish ethos - Nouns Esports can have multiple sponsors supporting our competitive initiative, and we will prioritize aligning with sponsors that share our values and vision for long-term growth - Onboarding - Gamers have typically been wary of the crypto space due to a lack of understanding and perceived complexity. However, the similarities between the gaming and crypto ecosystems, such as digital ownership and online communities, make them well-suited for each other - Nounish culture extended into esports has proven to be an amazing onboarding tool and we believe we can bridge the gap between gaming and crypto, showing gamers the potential benefits of crypto and its applications in and beyond the gaming world ## Risks and Challenges As an organization, it's crucial to consider the potential risks associated with discontinuing support for our esports teams. These teams are not just a source of entertainment for the community but also a representation of our brand and values. If we abruptly stop supporting them, we risk losing the trust and loyalty of the community we have worked hard to build. Another challenge that esports teams face is potential fluctuations in performance during the competitive season. To mitigate this risk, it's important to provide necessary support expected of tier one rosters, including management, coaching, bootcamps, and wellness support. This helps maintain the players' focus, discipline, and motivation, especially during challenging times. ## Budget Funding two professional esports teams for a minimum of 10 months. #### **Rosters** - 340,000 - 465,000 USDC - Two teams consisting of five players and one coach (12 people in total) - 125000 reserved for incentive payments, meaning it will be reflexive of the performance and effort put forth by the teams #### **Bootcamps** - 20,000-120,000 USDC - Funding the best practice opportunities prior to important competitions - Considered an essential need for top esports rosters - Costs may be reduced depending on the number of sponsored bootcamps (e.g. our Dota team has already received a free bootcamp in Europe during April, paid for by the organizers) #### **Support Staff** - 210,000 USDC - We are providing industry-standard support staff for these rosters - Two player managers who travel to events with the teams & organize their lives around regular competition - Professional wellness staff - Support staff for logistics, social media & content #### **Total: 795,000 USDC** (~435 ETH at current prices) --- ### **Multisig** We will be using the same multisig that was created for [Proposal 119](https://nouns.wtf/vote/119) consisting of Nouners and Nounsfolk. We will be swapping in Esports Pod member Peter as an active signer. - Sasquatch - Brennen - Maty - Oni - [Peter](https://twitter.com/Peterpandam) (Former [Dota Pro](https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Ppd), winner of The International, and previously CEO of [Evil Geniuses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_Geniuses)) ## Esports, Introduced We have recently created a fun & free open edition to celebrate Nouns Esports, which has been minted over 10,000 times (with a limit of 1 per wallet)! - _We have re-opened the mint for the duration of this proposal, you can find it at [mint.nouns.gg](mint.nouns.gg)_ [![](https://i.imgur.com/FaWnq7c.png)](http://mint.nouns.gg) ## Conclusion (ChatGPT TLDR) ![](https://i.imgur.com/isBe9fx.png) #### **Thank you for reading!**
