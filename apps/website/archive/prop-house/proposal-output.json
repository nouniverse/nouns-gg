In 2020, there was the release of the rollback net code client, Slippi, which as allowed me to hone my skillset to a formidable level. Having logged in over 30,000 matches over 3 years, I’ve had the wonderful experience of making many friends and testing my skill against high level competition</p>","value":"0","createdAt":"2024-03-15T12:07:52.000Z"},{"title":"(Paladin) I want to see if my practice is paying off!","user":"0xe6498AA51662Ba1396B8bd12C81FAA618c60Bf61","round":"battle-of-bc-2024","description":"<p>Hey, I'm Hrant \"Paladin\" Hanissian, a fox player from TN, I am actively ranked #2 in the state under Grab who is currently ranked 64th in the world. I started playing melee when I was 12 after watching Mango play Armada at MLG 2014 and have been hooked ever since. The majority of my gaming has taken place online through tools like smashladder so in person events are still pretty new to me despite how long I've been in the scene so this opportunity would mean a lot.</p><p><br></p><p>The majority of my impact on the scene has been online as well, I'm currently a moderator of the central Melee Online discord, I try and help make the scene a better place just trying to eliminate instances of toxicity that take place! Through this opportunity I've also met a lot of inspiring people that also volunteer their time to aid the scene and foster a better community and a positive place to find games.</p><p><br></p><p> I've been reassessing my approach to competing and changing my methods of conscious practice. I would love the opportunity to apply my practice at a major! Last year I placed around 33rd-49th at the majors I was able to attend and think I have what it takes to push past that given more opportunities. I am not able to travel as often as I would like, as a current full time student, and would love to see what I am capable of given more opportunities to compete. </p><p><br></p><p>I also have a cat named Rufus that I adore.</p><p><br></p><p>Thank you,</p><p>Hrant</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://ipfs.backend.prop.house/ipfs/QmRaJSQ8eabWDZFnFQ4zw6jLdCgDpvQJq3n44w261oxbae\"><img src=\"https://ipfs.backend.prop.house/ipfs/QmXVQS1YP9v7pV9H5F2LBqANQQMj8a31eaBxSogAXnD8Tj\" style=\"\" width=\"465\" height=\"381.6623376623377\"><img src=\"https://ipfs.backend.prop.house/ipfs/QmWHTRPwZjYeHCbYAc3WgAtSefXyzR2MuERDasop5rhkoW\" style=\"\" width=\"286\" height=\"381.3268286026201\"></p><p><img src=\"https://ipfs.backend.prop.house/ipfs/QmZGGgSPDV1ghL9b9wEHJSzHXxhgeski4kxnFBLGj26xGQ\" style=\"\" width=\"292\" height=\"355.6247362869198\"><img src=\"https://ipfs.backend.prop.house/ipfs/QmVmiGYehVuTy5awu6wJVjWicn8bGQUsWJ1oNSP3yoTmED\" style=\"\" width=\"613\" height=\"348.42840289429535\"></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>","value":"0","createdAt":"2024-03-09T20:31:23.000Z"},{"title":"meleesadposts","user":"0xcEb0b073a97CD5bB48E876ef415Dfe8f4DC03cb0","round":"battle-of-bc-2024","description":"<p>donkey kong wants to go to canada. if you vote for me and i get in, ill make a couple great youtube vids out of the experience!</p><p><br></p><p>One video aims to be a spiritual successor to the \"Slime on the Scene\" series.

It would be cool to see how I fare at a major, and getting to watch top level sets in person would be crazy.
