I have been a part of the melee scene for 8 years but I am yet to ever travel to the hub of melee in the world the USA. Mainly because as you might know I am not that great at the video game so why travel all that way when I could go around Europe.</p><p>However things have changed!</p><p>In the past year I have been chasing my dream of doing YouTube full time and have made many many videos on melee, its competitive history and goings on.</p><p>So now I want to finally make the trek to the US to connect with people I have never met in person and make content that I could only make from attending events like this, for example.</p><p><br></p><p>Vlogs: I have ideas for interesting vlogs that I could make attending events that people care about rather than my uk locals which while really cool doesn't grab the broad range of people.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>On the ground Docs: I am in a period of change for my channel where I will undoubtedly be doing more large scale documentaries (Hopefully my first is live by the time you can vote) so being able to go and meet these people I have been documenting and getting real interviews with them sounds like a dream come true as well as better content for you guys.</p><p><br></p><p>if you want an example of any of these style of videos go check out the<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@ChalerYT/videos\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> channel</a> or maybe you have already watched my stuff and just don't know it. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrMwna7sQiU&amp;t=425s\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;Doc</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tefmQsilUQU&amp;t=2s\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;Vlog</a></p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Zw4kFtyO8y4GpaASxhU2ki28ARAmOTRDHtIG06mNidQ1YBMucEo2rSCW5otGLlrBOO4WlG3KDRT_tvmWztOtGvmYuQ8_iD3Rsboc5U7FjE2hd3486d04Y5TKOQ-VHCX5aIOEz5VRjOSdIAMlYN2QHFQ\"></p><p><img src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/jD0lNTEvUe8Rb-uEyEdGE0BZIuyBSr-56M5C3x5W66aaZTJQ_E4K4yzQL6mhJIsF-jA50KN-S4Puw9WNkVAShRztAHqrhAWH7DMj4NgORp3ky9w-a2BE6VbPuS82NFoCql2bFPWqS-YZouu6Axc1TKE\"></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Commentary</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Over the past year I have really been pushing my commentary, taking notes from great commentators in Europe and doing the best I can to be both entertaining and informative.</p><p>I really feel my commentary has reached a solid level in this time so I would love the chance to commentate in front of more people as a opportunity like<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaXxV9GK76U\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Fete</a> only comes around ever so often in Europe.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Competing</strong></p><p><br></p><p>So yeah I'm not the best I don't have any crazy wins or anything like that but if you are a real stats nerd would it not be fun to compare the peak of average in the UK vs the American field? Idk just stacking on whatever I can here and being as transparent as I can be that competition while not being the main focus anymore is 100% something I still enjoy and take seriously so I would love to see how I hold up.</p><p>This opportunity would genuinely mean the world to me and I promise to deliver as much as I physically can from this one trip. So if you vote for me please let me know (also its my birthday on the date of collusion... so that's fun if that influences you at all)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>",

Now that I have graduated college, I have had more time than ever to obsess over this beautiful game. Going to collision would help my improvement as a player immensely. I've been living in the middle of basically nowhere for some time and have little to no access to top level talent to play. I spend hours daily playing and this opportunity would make it even more worth it. This game means the world to me and this experience would be priceless.
