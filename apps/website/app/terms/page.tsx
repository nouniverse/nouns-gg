      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          The information provided when using the Services is not intended for
          distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or
          country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or
          regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement
          within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who
          choose to access the Services from other locations do so on their own
          initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws,
          if and to the extent local laws are applicable.

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>

          regulations (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
          (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.),
          so if your interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may not
          use the Services. You may not use the Services in a way that would
          violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).
