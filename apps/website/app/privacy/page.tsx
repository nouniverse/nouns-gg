      <p>
        In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it
        is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do
        so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to

          <strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your information
          when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate

          personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:{" "}

        <li>
          If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would
          compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the

          breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a
          province{" "}
        </li>

        <strong>6. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          <em>
            In Short: If you choose to register or log in to our Services using
            a social media account, we may have access to certain information
            about you.
          </em>
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your
        third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or X
        logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile
        information about you from your social media provider. The profile
        information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider
        concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends
        list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to
        make public on such a social media platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are
        described in this Privacy Notice or that are otherwise made clear to you
        on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are
        not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your
        third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their
        privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your
        personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on
        their sites and apps.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          <em>
            In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to
            fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless
            otherwise required by law.
          </em>
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
        necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a
        longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
        accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will
        require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period
        of time in which users have an account with us.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
        personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
        information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
        personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
        securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
        processing until deletion is possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong>
      </p>

            In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a
            system of organizational and technical security measures.

        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
        organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any
        personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and
        efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the
        Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100%
        secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals,
        or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our
        security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your
        information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
        information, transmission of personal information to and from our
        Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within
        a secure environment.

      <p>
        <strong>9. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</strong>

        <strong>
          <em>
            In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to
            children under 18 years of age.

      </p>
      <p>
        We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children
        under 18 years of age, nor do we knowingly sell such personal
        information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least
        18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to
        such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal
        information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we
        will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly
        delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we
        may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at
        privacy@nouns.gg.

        Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process
        your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent
        depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your
        consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by
        contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section
        &quot;HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?&quot; below.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the
        processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will
        it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in

        <strong>11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
        applications include a Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting
        you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
        about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this
        stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing
        DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to
        DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
        communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for
        online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
        inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy
        Notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser
        DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal
        standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to
        them at this time.

        Under certain US state data protection laws, you can designate an
        authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. We may deny a request
        from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been

        laws.

      <p>
        <strong>Request Verification</strong>
      </p>

        our system. We will only use personal information provided in your
        request to verify your identity or authority to make the request.
        However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already
        maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information
        for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or
        fraud-prevention purposes.

        If you submit the request through an authorized agent, we may need to
        collect additional information to verify your identity before processing
        your request and the agent will need to provide a written and signed
        permission from you to submit such request on your behalf.

        taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written
